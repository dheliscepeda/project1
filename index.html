			Hi! My name is Dhelis (pronounced duh-lease :)), and I am a senior here at Hunter. I am, hopefully, graduating at the end of this term with a major in Media Studies, concentration in Emerging Media. Fun fact, I used to be an Accounting major until I realized that if the first accounting course I took was brutal, I didn't want to know how the rest of the field looked. 
			<br><br><br>
			Creativity was my thing, and I wanted to figure out how I could make a living with it, so graphic design fell into my lap. Before I even declared this major, I always found myself taking on tasks that were design-driven and part of skillsets I had no experience in. For example, I dabbled in web design before college and enjoyed doing it to the point where I got semi-good at it, and people started paying me for it. Of course, this was through "you can do it too" sites like Wix and Squarespace. Though I still do web design this way, I always wondered how it's done from scratch, so here I am! I've learned a lot from the first web production course and now I'm excited to see how much more I can learn in part two!
